# MER2025 Dataset

Welcome to the official dataset for the **[MER2025 Challenge@ACM MM](https://zeroqiaoba.github.io/MER2025-website/)**!

MER2025 marks the third edition of our **Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER)** series of challenges, aiming to bring together the affective computing community to explore emerging trends and future directions. This year, MER2025 focuses on the theme:  
### **"Affective Computing Meets Large Language Models"**

We seek to shift from traditional categorical emotion recognition frameworks, which rely on predefined taxonomies, towards **LLM-driven generative methods**, offering innovative solutions for more accurate and interpretable emotion understanding.

Baseline code is available here: [MERTools for MER2025](https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/MERTools/tree/master/MER2025)

## üåê News

- **April 30, 2025**: MER25 Challenge and MRAC25 Workshop website launched!

## üî• Challenge Tracks

MER2025 features four tracks:

### Track 1. MER-SEMI
Enhancing categorical emotion recognition through **semi-supervised learning**.  
Participants are encouraged to leverage methods such as masked auto-encoders and contrastive learning to improve performance using both labeled and unlabeled data.

- Predict one label from six categories: **worried, happy, neutral, angry, surprise, sad**.

### Track 2. MER-FG
Moving beyond basic emotions to **fine-grained emotional states**[1, 2].  
Participants can use LLMs to predict **any emotion labels**, capturing more nuanced emotional expressions.

### Track 3. MER-DES
Integrating **multimodal clues** for **explainable emotion recognition**[2, 3].  
Instead of relying solely on emotion words, participants must submit **both multimodal evidence and emotion labels**, enhancing interpretability.

### Track 4. MER-PR
Exploring the relationship between **emotion recognition and personality prediction**.  
Participants are encouraged to use techniques like multi-task learning to determine whether better emotion recognition improves personality prediction.
